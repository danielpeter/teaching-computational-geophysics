# Computational Geophysics - Course

This repository holds additional course material to teach computational geophysics.

## Syllabus

An introduction to finite-difference, pseudo-spectral, finite-element, and spectral-element methods will be presented
and applied to basic geophysical problems including heat flow and wave propagation.

The course offers hands-on lab experience in numerically solving partial differential equations relevant to geophysics.
